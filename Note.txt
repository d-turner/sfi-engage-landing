1. Create Droplet selecting Discourse from the digitalocean marketplace (not ubuntu)
2. Go to AWS Simple Email Service
  a. Verify new domain
  b. Enter domain name copy all the keys and values down for each record 
  c. These will be used for verifying emails are coming from our domain

3. Go to the domain hosting provider and copy the records from AWS into the DNS settings (this differs for each provider and can take a few hours to update)


Automation Script
1. Update paths in nodeScript.sh to point to the correct places
2. Update script for the new platform
  a. Update the URL variable definition
  b. Update the apiKey to be a newly created key generated on the platform (from an admin account)
  c. Update the username to be the corresponding username that the key was generated for
  d. Update the eventDate variable
  e. Update the nowOnId; this is the id given to the private category for holding the 'Now On' topics
  f. Update the comingUpId; this is the id given to the private category for holding the 'Coming Up' topics
  g. Update the finishedId; this is the id given to the private category for finished topics
  To find these IDs you can run:
  curl http://www.imaginenuig.icu/categories.json?username={username}&apiKey={apiKey} | grep 'name'
  and look for the matching IDs or you can browse to <URL>/categories.json when logged in as an admin and find the ids that way

3. Install dependencies
npm install node-fetch --save
4. Add the script as a cronjob
  a. sudo crontab -e
  b. Add the following at the end to run the script every 15 minutes
  */15 * * * * <FULL_PATH_TO_SCRIPT>/nodeScript.sh
  c. Check the output to make sure nodejs is available from the cron manager and the script is working
  d. If not use the full path for nodejs in nodeScript.sh and check the output again
Notes: Since I was working in a different time zone it was important to explicitly set the Date object properly
there is probably a cleaner way of doing it
